This a pain song but I'm letting everything go
I promise when, I speak specifically about anything
'Cause that's my way of showing I don't care no more
I'ma just go with my life
Until death call my name
Ayy, ayy, Youngboy, slime yeah (Playboy on this bitch but he ain't playing though)

Too many problems, yeah
Thinking how I'm gon' solve it, yeah
So much pain in my body, yeah
They selling lies and I bought it, yeah
Don't tell me that you love me if you ain't gon' die for me, yeah
You can stay the fuck from 'round me if you ain't gon' ride for me, yeah
Told me you would never leave, how can you just lie to me? Yeah
Get from off your knees, you ain't got to cry to me, yeah
I been giving all my love, tell me, do you feel it?
Never learned how to trust sittin' in penitentiary
All for you, I'll take a slug, baby, who the realest?
Had to tell her I'm a genie, I can answer wishes, yeah

I got my static when you ride with me
We get pulled over no you ain't going to do no time for me
I put my hands up police drew down on me
So many charges make me wanna go away overseas
Reminiscing 'bout them days I was sittin' up in that cage
I was begging you to stay and you hung up in my face
Free Kodak, everything gettin' slayed
They keep begging me to change
Talked to Future the other day and he say I need to change lanes (Yeah)
Cause they gon' try to count you out til you make them count you in (Yeah)
Stimulate my brain (Yeah, yeah) had to tell 'em I ain't leaving out the same way I came in (Yeah, oh, fuck what I saying)
Whole lotta heroin, I sell that shit right in front of my momma
Swear I would never run just like a man I'ma face my problems
Even when my voice fucked up
I'ma spit in the booth I'ma go in like a goblin
Nigga got me fucked up
I'ma spin on his block, I admit that I had shot him
VVSs in my chain tell that ho Young Thug everything
Hearing voices in brain hoping everything change
I been rolling through the streets and been clutching on my heat
I put blood all on my feet and I put cameras in my trees (Baby)
Said I changed on you, but I feel that you changed on me (Changed on me)
I said my prayers and you gon' sow just what you reap (Yeah)
I been taking Adderall mixing it with lean (Mixin' it with lean)
Hope I don't wake up out my sleep
Too many problems, yeah (Too many problems)
Thinking how I'm gon' solve it, yeah (Solve 'em, gon' solve 'em)
So much pain in my body, yeah (So much pain in my body)
They selling lies and I bought it, yeah (Selling lies and I bought it)
Don't tell me that you love me if you ain't gon' die for me, yeah (Oh)
You can stay the fuck from 'round me if you ain't gon' ride for me, yeah (Oh)
Told me you would never leave, how can you just lie to me? Yeah (Oh)
Get from off your knees, you ain't got to cry to me, yeah
I been giving all my love, tell me, do you feel it?
Never learned how to trust sittin' in penitentiary
All for you, I'll take a slug, baby, who the realest?
Had to tell her I'm a genie, I can answer wishes, yeah (Can answer wishes, slime)

Being in love never help me solve my problems (Solve my problems)
I wish that I could find a girl just like my mama
I don't wanna hurt nobody, but still ride around with that chopper (Yeah)
Zoe life to the end, tell them free the main sniper (Tell 'em free Kodak)

Yeah (I call that)
Slatt, slatt, slatt
That's all life

(Drum Dummie)
(Drum Dummie made the beat and I'm gon' kill it)
Oh, this Drum Dummie who made this beat, huh?
I ain't flashin', though
I'm just coolin' right now
It ain't nobody but me and Herm in the studio
And I'm just bored
And I hope y'all was waitin' to hear from me, so
I just went and recorded

Real street nigga, I ain't tryna feel no sorrow (No)
Drive that Maybach like a fuckin' Monte Carlo
I been tryna find some peace and only God know (Yeah)
Cross me once, can't call my phone, you get the dial tone
I been on fleek, I'm poppin' (I'm poppin')
Not many 'round, if you don't know, it helped my pockets (My pockets)
And my bro take that Draco and go wildin' (Bah, bah)
Tryna grow up, don't come in contact with that violence
Violins should be played how I'm stylin'
"Comment where?" She like, "What picture? That ain't my bitch"
Tired of the bayou, I wan' take it out to New York
And live a high life like a nigga signed with Highbridge
I flash out and take his head from off his body
I never once showed you that side, but that's who I'm is
Hidin' out, I let that .30 spit on College
If I die right now, just check the stats and see how I did
I'm a real street nigga, yeah
I just pulled my 'Retta out and tried to stop a nigga (Where you goin'?)
I just walked outside my house and almost shot a nigga (Fuck is you doin'?)
Fuck my ex, I hope my next can probably top her, nigga
Take me to a place I can't imagine (Oh)
Victim of heartbreak and I'm so damaged (Oh)
Steppin' in blood with these thugs and I can't panic
Yeah, we knocked him off, nigga, what? They gotta hand it

I just took the foreign, went on the block and took the top off
Talkin' out his top, I go by Top, I get him knocked off
See them youngins hoppin' out that Benz, that's some dropouts
They was hatin', I knocked 'em out my lens, that ain't my fault
I'm with Herm, I'm drinkin' on that Henn' like a pawpaw
Pure codeine, they drinkin' on that gin, I been goin' off
Goin' off on, on all these hoes waitin' on me to fall
I walked in court dirty as the fuck with pee up in my drawers (Woo)
Bitch, I'm drunker than a fuck, I need some Tylenol
I go nuts, soon as you buck, I shoot at all of y'all (Bah, bah)
I left therapy with K3 and I sped off
Talkin' proper as the fuck with my head off
Talkin' proper as the fuck with my head off
Been goin' crazy, but I can't let my son see it all
All this love got me damaged, I just want it gone
If you my friend, let's get it in, bitch, take your panties off53EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
   <| Song By youngboy never broke again |>   
 
Mmm, mmm
Yeah, mmm
Oh yeah
As I ride on the city lights
I wonder who gon' ride for me if it go down
And I start to get this feeling like
Who gon' be there for my sons the day that I'm not around?

I hope you love me as much as I love you
I ain't mean to break your heart, but baby, that's what thugs do
Nothing in the world, baby I wouldn't do for you
If I die right now it's so much that I would lose

I'ma tell you now I always be there for you
If it go down now, I know Baby Joe gon' shoot
If you go broke now they ain't gon' do shit for you
Can't give up now, nigga this the life I choose

Back in 8th grade, I swear I ain't have a thing baby
Since I got money, I swear it ain't been the same baby
Got money in my pocket, diamonds in my chain baby
I won't ever hurt again, I made it through the rain baby
Before the fame, I was strapped up on Valley Park with a Glock
I was sellin' them rocks, these police stay watchin' steady passin' by the block
I created that gang, forever I bang, nigga I'll never stop
I stay in my lane, I'm never gon' change, nigga playin', he get popped
I told him record me, I go safari, diamonds wetter than some water
Hellcat not a Charger, way faster than a 'Rari (skrt)
I'm turnin' up in the party, celebratin' all the shit that I did
I told my momma I'm a gangster, I'll never change the way that I live (nah)

Back in 8th grade, I ain't have a thing baby
Since I got money, I swear it ain't been the same baby
Got money in my pocket, diamonds in my chain baby
I won't ever hurt again, I made through the rain baby

I hope you love me as much as I love you
I ain't mean to break your heart, but baby, that's what thugs do
Nothing in the world, baby I wouldn't do for you
If I die right now, it's so much that I would lose

That I would lose
Ahh ahh ahhh (Ahh)
My voice messed up right now
Mmm
Ahh baby
Out the blue, I do some magic like I be Houdini
My diamonds wet, they Aquafina like they made in Fiji
I get that Act', I crack the seal, and pour it in some Fiji
I cop a 'vette, I drop my top, and ask you, "Did you see me?"
Gone off that molly, I'm zooted and booted
Got snake on my collar, I tell you it's Gucci
I swear that I'm bout it, you play I'ma shoot it
I'm a 38 baby I swear that I'm ruthless
Walkin' on stage, I'm strapped with a toolie
Long clips, nigga I shoot a movie
I know you notice how we come through and do it
Eviction notice, nigga, bet that you movin'
Red dot and head shots for who wanna do me
Homicides, mommas cry, it ain't nothing to it
I tote them choppas, when we slide, you know I'ma shoot it
So many times I could've died, but you niggas blew it (slatt)

Back in 8th grade, I ain't have a thing baby
Since I got money, I swear it ain't been the same baby
Got money in my pocket, diamonds in my chain baby
I won't ever hurt again, I made through the rain baby

I hope you love me as much as I love you
I ain't mean to break your heart, but baby, that's what thugs do
Nothing in the world, baby I wouldn't do for you
If I die right now, it's so much that I would lose
I would lose
Yeah

I remember I wanted for to quit for so many times
But I knew this moment'd come, now it's my time
I gotta make up for all them nights that my Momma cried
I'm goin' in, I'm putting everything on the line
Dropped out of school to chase my dream, I had some for to prove
I put my all in this shit, man I can't fuckin' lose
They smile up in my face but they don't know what I been through
Whole lotta nights I went to sleep and I ain't had no food
But now I'm up and I'm just thinking about my next move
Gotta keep my head above water, gotta make it through
I do this shit for my momma and my lil' brother too
Ain't no more problems now I might as well go back to school
Gotta maintain, stay on my grind no I can't be no fool
Naw I can't slip nor I can't fumble, gotta stick and move
Get out BR, move to LA, where I ain't gotta keep a tool
Surprise but I knew my dreams coming true

We had nothing, stayed down 'til I came up with my niggas
Right or wrong forever right, you know wassup with me nigga
Never change on my gang yeah, I'm stuck with my niggas
We untouchable come run that money up with me nigga
We had nothing, stayed down 'til I came up with my niggas
Right or wrong forever right, you know wassup with me nigga
Never change on my gang yeah, I'm stuck with my niggas
We untouchable come run that money up with me nigga
Now that I made it, ain't none the same it all changed
When I'm in public people see me they screaming my name
Just a few days ago I was locked up in them chains
Now I'm in back of the Maybach with a lot of bands
I ain't worry 'bout 'em dissin' naw, I don't hear a thing they sayin'
This for my sons in Montana and can't forget Lil Ben
I never jeopardize this and lose it all again
This for that North, 38 baby, they know I ain't playing
From the heart I appreciate all of my fans
This for Monique for loving me and bein' my helping hand
I really did it, this for for mom's, 3Three, Trey and Aaron
Can't nobody tell me nothing I'm like what you sayin'

We had nothing, stayed down 'til I came up with my niggas
Right or wrong forever right, you know wassup with me nigga
Never change on my gang yeah, I'm stuck with my niggas
We untouchable come run that money up with me nigga
We had nothing, stayed down 'til I came up with my niggas
Right or wrong forever right, you know wassup with me nigga
Never change on my gang yeah, I'm stuck with my niggas
We untouchable come run that money up with me nigga22EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
